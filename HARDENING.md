## Findings Fixed

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The composite action step references `gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@v3.5.0`, which is pinned to a mutable version tag rather than an immutable 40-character commit SHA. If the tag is moved (intentionally or via a supply-chain compromise), the action will silently execute different code. It should be pinned to a full SHA, e.g. `gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@<40-char-sha> # v3.5.0`.

## Iteration Notes
